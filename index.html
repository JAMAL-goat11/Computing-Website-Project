        <h2>What is Elyon Christian School??</h2>
        <p>Elyon Christian School is a holistic school that doesn't only teach academics, but also moral values. We learn about manners, respect, and following the school rules.</p>

        <h2>Why do we need to follow rules?</h2>
        <p>Following rules is very important in daily life, especially in career. It helps us to be disciplined, resposible, and have great value, which is required for work. Being resposible makes other people comfortable to work with us.</p>
